2007.11.05 - In around 2006, Korea has been a big issue by hacking from China. At that time, I was able to experience a lot of hacked machines. In there, I did catch a windows binary that related to network technique and that file name was "lcx.exe". I thought, "This tool will be very useful from pen-test". So I implemented a clone program of tool.
